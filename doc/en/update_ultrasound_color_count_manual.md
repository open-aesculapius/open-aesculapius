# Manually changing the number of displayed ultrasound image colors [![en](https://img.shields.io/badge/en-ru-green.svg)](../ru/update_ultrasound_color_count_manual.ru.md)
This file contains a description of a method for manually changing the number of displayed ultrasound image colors.

# The basic idea
The module automatically reduces the number of unique colors in an image using the K-means clustering algorithm. This approach allows you to adjust the contrast and simplify the color representation, while maintaining the visual interpretability and anatomical features of the image.

The module receives an ultrasound image as an input, both singleâ€”channel (grayscale) and color (in BGR space). The image is converted into an array of features: each pixel is represented by either an intensity or a vector of three components.

Next, the K-means algorithm is applied with a given number of clusters. Each pixel is replaced by the nearest centroid, resulting in a compact color palette. The final image retains the structure and details of the original, but contains a limited number of unique colors, which makes it more convenient for visual analysis or subsequent processing.

# Demonstration
An example was used to demonstrate how the module works `simple_update_ultrasound_color_count_manual.py `, located on the following path:

```
<root of the project>/examples/simple_update_ultrasound_color_count_manual.py
```


Below is the original image used as input data.:

The result of the module is an image with a reduced number of displayed colors:
